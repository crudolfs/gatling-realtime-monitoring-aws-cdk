# AWS CDK project for Gatling realtime monitoring on AWS ECS
This module contains an [AWS CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/home.html) app for a Gatling Realtime Monitoring solution on AWS ECS that 
consists of the following 2 stacks:
1. GatlingVpcStack: contains a VPC with a private and public subnet (redundant in two availability zones)
2. GatlingEcsStack: contains an ECS cluster with three services (gatling-runner, grafana and influxdb)

## AWS CDK installation
The AWS CDK command line tool (cdk) and the AWS Construct Library are developed in TypeScript and run on Node.js.
Therefore you must have Node.js version >= 10.3.0 installed. Installing the AWS CDK is easy:

`npm install -g aws-cdk`

Then verify your installation:

`cdk --version`

### Prerequisites
Make sure the following is in place:

- [Specify AWS credentials and region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html#getting_started_credentials)

The configuration of AWS credentials and region are very important, it's key to make the infrastructure deployment work correctly.
Make sure that when using the --profile option you specify the credentials in the ~/.aws/config file instead of the ~/.aws/credentials file 
which is normally the case when using profiles with the AWS CLI.  

**Note**: The aws-mfa tool may be helpful when MFA is enforced on your AWS account: https://github.com/broamski/aws-mfa

## Useful commands
* `npm run build`   compile TypeScript to JavaScript
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the Jest unit tests
 * `cdk ls --profile <profile-name>` list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth GatlingVpcStack --profile <profile-name>` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template for the GatlingVpcStack
 * `cdk synth GatlingEcsStack --profile <profile-name>` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template for the GatlingEcsFargateStack
 * `cdk deploy GatlingVpcStack --profile <profile-name>` deploy the GatlingVpcStack to the AWS account/region as specified by the provided profile
 * `cdk deploy GatlingEcsStack --profile <profile-name>` deploy the GatlingEcsFargateStack to the AWS account/region as specified by the provided profile
 * `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs` open CDK documentation
 
 ## Deploy instructions
 The stack should be deployed in the following order:
 1. GatlingVpcStack (optional)
 2. GatlingEcsStack
 
 Use the --profile option to make sure that the stack is deployed to the correct AWS account/region.
 
 ```
cdk deploy GatlingVpcStack --profile <profile-name>
cdk deploy GatlingEcsStack --profile <profile-name>
```

## Run services on AWS
The AWS ECS section of [gatling-monitoring](../../gatling-monitoring/README.md) explains how to run this solution on AWS.
